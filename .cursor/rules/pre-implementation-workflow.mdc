description: Before implementing, check current phase and read referenced docs

# Pre-Implementation Workflow

Before writing any code or making changes:

## 1. Determine Which Document Applies

- **PHASES.md** – Backend logic, API, calculation services, frontend logic (types, services, forms)
- **DESIGN-PHASES.md** – Frontend design migration (Tailwind, styling, UI components)

## 2. Check Current Phase

- Open the relevant phases document
- Identify the current phase (lowest unchecked phase)
- Do not skip phases
- Do not merge phases – one phase = one focused prompt

## 3. Read Referenced Docs First

When a phase or task says:
- "Reference: X" or "Before starting: read Y"
- Read that file before writing code
- Do not assume you know its contents
- Apply constraints and patterns from that file

## 4. Verify Prerequisites

- Confirm all "Before starting" tasks are done
- Check that dependencies for the current phase are complete (e.g. atoms before molecules)

## 5. Follow Phase Constraints

- Respect any "Constraint" or "Do NOT" sections in the phase
- Stick to specified file paths; do not invent alternatives
